                          <P>Information about privacy in music apps <br><br>

                            Many music applications nowadays track a lot of activity
                            from user streaming. A lot of this is behind the scenes,
                            and is intended to create advertisements to profit from 
                            the user. <br><br>

                            With each song you stream, you leak just a little bit more
                            of information about yourself, your personality, and your
                            interests. It goes further than that, too. Behavioral data 
                            can be tracked through searches, such as a breakup playlist.
                             <br><br>

                            How does one fix such intrusive tracking of user information
                            on such a complex backend? Well, simplifying that backend and
                            displaying it to the user does exactly that. Making a database
                            that is solely intended for the user to edit their music on their
                            application eliminates the chance of user tracking. Being transparent
                            with the user and showing what the backend accomplishes allows for
                            the user to be aware of what the application is doing in plain sight. <br><br>

                            Our application does exactly that. We have a home screen your music, as well
                            as a database which shows to the user what the backend accomplishes. In this
                            database, you can search, add, delete, or modify your music. That's it, and
                            that's all you really need. It's that simple.
