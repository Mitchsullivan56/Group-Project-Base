Many music applications nowadays track a lot of activity from user streaming. A lot of this is behind the scenes, and is intended to create advertisements to profit from the user. With each song you stream, you leak just a little bit more
of information about yourself, your personality, and your interests. How does one fix such intrusive tracking of user information on such a complex backend? Well, simplifying that backend and displaying it to the user. Our application does exactly that. We have a home screen your music, as well as a database which shows to the user what the backend accomplishes. In this database, you can search, add, delete, or modify your music. That's it, and
that's all you really need. It's that simple.
